Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing \u201cThe Other\u201d always violent?

This covers problems like irrigation management, crop maintenance, soil fertility maintenance, crop yield improvement, pesticide management in compliance with good agricultural practices.  2        WORK FLOW  ---------------------------- The innovation focuses on developing a smart centralized system to control different requirements for a farm per crop being grown. An IoT based system integrates the cloud AI services with that of the hardware and sensors in the farms / fields which constantly stream real-time information to the servers. Depending on various other parameters like humidity, temperature and other meteorological data, predictions of the requirements of the farm is calculated and the hardware device which automatically opens the valves for irrigation / warns the farmer about doing a scheduled check in the localized language is made via SMS. This provides a centralized GIS collection of the soil data allowing extensive research and work by the agricultural scientists to guide the farmers in a given area for the crop they're growing. Simultaneously it provides the data for governments to optimize on the water irrigation routes / canals so that other drought struck areas can ensure water in times of need. The hardware solution consists of various sensors connected to the GSM chip module on board which allows the farmers to irrigate the farms when needed or transmit data to the required scientists/soil experts in the area who could help.  \u2022        It keeps updating the data base on parameters such as soil temperature, humidity, air temperature, determine frost and heat events, forecast harvest time. \u2022        It maps the fields from phone using GPS and input field sampling information.  \u2022        This systems aims for mobile first and cloud first implementation. \u2022        It integrates pest management system by observing, inspecting, and identifying certain trends in the pests and pesticides. It keeps the track record. \u2022        Last but not the least, it proposes high yielding plans and best crop management plans even under disasters.  3        FIELDS ARE THE NEW OFFICES AND DATA IS DRIVING THE TRACTORS  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are trying to use the emerging Cloud based technologies in AI, machine learning and big data to solve important problems as well as to get the problem notified to the related person in real time. This system allows farmers to monitor and maintain the quality of their farms by sitting at their home just using simple services like SMS in case there is no internet connectivity present in the area or by using the app built for android phones. The hardware is also sending data of the farm to the agricultural scientists who can use it to make data driven decisions. Integrations with the other meteorological information helps to offer the best advice for irrigation. This system can also be used to inform the farmers in a particular area in case of an agricultural outbreak risk in that area. The other solutions include animal breeding and maintaining the data informing the farmers about the required medication needed for the cattle.

While the term QA will likely evoke a combination of fear, disdain, or any of a plethora of negative emotions from anyone who has worked in a traditional enterprise development environment and probably scare them off. The top down approach, strict bureaucracy, and other issues which are often synonymous with QA teams doesn't have to be the case. There can be real benefits to having a dedicated QA effort on an open source project. It enables transparency in how testing is done, lets anyone contribute and collaborate, and can signal to consumers the stability of a project. Larger projects can especially reap a lot of benefit from having people working on the QA side of a project upstream.

Our main aim of this project is to give the total guidance for the blind.Have you all ever thought of the problems faced by the blind people? No will be the answer unless otherwise you are a blind.Even we didn't realise the problems  before starting our project.First we started with  listing down the problems faced by the blind people and then started finding the solutions for it. So we came up with the following problems. 1. Difficulty in finding the obstructions on their path. 2. Difficulty in reading the road signs and traffic <a href=\"http://signals.So\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">signals.So</a> they can't either drive or walk safely on the road. 3. Difficulty in reading the price <a href=\"http://tag.So\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tag.So</a> sellers can cheat them. 4. Difficulty in reading books.Since all the books are not translated to Braille letters.  5. Can't watch TV.   So we divided these problems into easy, advance and crazy to work on it.First we started working on the basic problems.The first solution we came up was using ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstructions.We created an app which is user friendly (blind person just have to tap) to give the voice <a href=\"http://output.So\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">output.So</a> we just fixed  3 ultra sonic sensors( per shoe front,back,left/right) and depending on the sensor output the voice will be given as output.Still we have problem in detecting in hanging obstructions and pits.We are trying to replace something with shoe which can fulfil all the conditions.Within a span of two weeks we have completed this task.Further we are working with image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to find the solutions for reading road signs(Image processing) and traffic signals(Colour recognition), reading books(Text to speech conversion) and finally for watching TV. As an engineer I suggest others also to work on the projects which would help the highly needed people. Because we never know the problems faced by the poor people and differently-able people. And they don't have enough knowledge or capability to work on their own problems.  ------------------------------------------   Problem Background: Corneal Blindness is one of the most common causes of blindness in India. India shoulders the largest burden of global blindness, about 3.5 million across the country with 30000 new cases being added each year. People who are visually impaired face no shortage of problems in India, where living with disabilities can be especially challenging. Pedestrians are often forced off of side walks that are cluttered with vendors, animals and other obstacles. And because of the difficulty of moving independently, accessing services is also difficult. Blind people typically use canes, of course, but the traditional cane can't detect objects higher than the waist.   Problem Statement: The problem is now to provide them with an alternative guide to the cane, a guide with a more human like approach.  Proposed Solution: Our proposed solution is to develop shoes starting from the most basic level to a highly advanced AI version of those shoes. The steps are as follows: \u2981 Develop a model of shoes with 4 sensors for 4 different directions. These sensors can be distance or IR Led ones. A microcontroller interface would be in place to transmit voice messages through a communications module to the headset of the person wearing the shoes. \u2981 In the intermediate stage the model would contain 4 cameras instead of sensors. The camera\u2019s working on basic image processing would be able to make out textures, landscapes and obstructions to a degree as defined by the manufacturer. \u2981 The final stage would involve trying to get the shoes to define the situations it are placed in by themselves using image processing and machine learning.  End users: The blind people around the world. Since our final product doesn't make use of smart/mobile phone, the person who can use it need not be aware of it. The output will be given as sound through headsets. Devices: Shoes, 4 cameras, 4 sensors,  headset, a micro controller and other electronic components Platforms, Technologies to be used: Machine learning in Matlab using image processing, interfacing camera, sensor and headset Data set, tools, resources useful in developing solution: Can choose any image processing tools and other technologies.", "session_type": {"name": "Talk of 20 minutes", "length": 0.3, "id": 432}, "video": null, "speakers": [{"name": "Jaminy Prabaharan", "organisation": "Smart guidance for blind", "id": 1233}], "subtitle": null, "signup_url": null, "track": {"name": "Hardware and IoT", "id": 249}, "audio": null, "short_abstract": "Short Abstract for the event", "microlocation": {"name": "Eco Garden Lab", "id": 242}}, {"end_time": "2016-03-19T11:00:00", "state": "accepted", "start_time": "2016-03-19T10:30:00", "slides": null, "comments": "", "title": "Machine Tools: How companies like Apple, Xiaomi and Samsung manufacture at scale?", "language": null, "id": 1788, "long_abstract": "I'm going to give an overview about the machine tool industry and how manufacturing takes place at a scale.

In this case the system is made out of sensors, actuators and are connected to the cloud. The user visualizes all the sensor and actuator endpoints as simple building blocks on the browser. Interconnecting these blocks virtually on the browser creates a actual data flow in the real world (basically over the air configuration of all sensors and actuators). The user can then add triggers, events, timers, filters to the flow to create more complex IoT systems.  The top three highlights of the framework: * Setting up the IoT application can be completely visual. i.e. no programming required. (But code can be added if the user wants to) * The system can work over any wired/wireless medium - like bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, etc. * The framework is platform neutral. Though it is been developed on the Beaglebone Black, it will run fine on Raspberry Pi, Cubie board, etc. Not limited by the hardware.

It can be seen as similar to cloud-formation from AWS. Within this short workshop with  this tool I am creating a basic two-tier  infrastructure stack in a single command. What I will do it in one stroke of command is Create a complete infrastructure in AWS VPC running an app server, What are the things happening in this one command:  - Creating a VPC. - Creating a subnets one public and private. - Creating respective security groups and rules. - Creating a load balancer. - Creating a app server running an web server called nginx. - Attaching a server to ELB and giving us a public DNS by which we can access the app. - And it gives a simple sketch diagram of our infrastructure as well. Thus we have full fledged app running on Cloud in single Command.

The talk will show that ethemeral datastores aren't implicit contradictions and discuss how to implement this idea. The main problem is to deal with scale-out and scale-back situations. There are several ways to tackle that challenge, including, but not limited to to active-passive-clusters, read slaves, active-active-solutions ora couple of NoSQL solutions. Most of them are pretty complex to set up and operate, though.  Crate is an open source database that speaks SQL to the frontend, but scales horizontally by just adding more nodes. A demo shows how to set up a distributed application with a database cluster using Docker in less than 15 lines of orchestration code and compares it to other database clusters.

I also intent to speak on Federated Message Bus (fedmsg) within the infra through which the message passing takes place.

It's currently functional as a basic IRC bouncer, however, unlike mainstream IRC bouncers, it supports multiple client connections for the same IRC network connection for a user. It aims to provide a scalable bouncer service along with easy setup, deployment and management. It also envisions to provide a low barrier entry point for users, where users can join and start using the service in an automated fashion, without going through manual processes.  Although, ircb is a standalone product, it is also one of the core components of waartaa2. waartaa is our attempt to create an open source SAAS communication and collaboration tool, around IRC. We also participated in GSoC under the Fedora umbrella. However, we hit various roadblocks with the initial code base given to it's monolithic structure. So, we started breaking down the app into micro services. Thus, ircb, the scalable IRC bouncer to empower waartaa, was born.  IRC networks limit the number of connections for an IP, and this limit has to be manually negotiated, and the process takes time. We came to know of this during maintaining a demo instance of waartaa on a single node, when Freenode will stop rejecting IRC connections from our IP. That's why we are looking forward to have a multi node model for ircb, where we can intelligently distribute the IRC network connections, as needed. We are also brainstorming to figure out an intelligent way to load balance connections from IRC clients to the bouncer service in a stateless fashion. You can find some insight about it in our initial design docs3.

As a result, there is a emerging demand to migrate database systems to PostgreSQL from Oracle. In this presentation, we will report on the following two tools which greatly help our migration projects: * SQL Imcompatibility detection tool (db_syntax_diff) * Oracle emulating function libraries \"orafce\" and our enhancement   We are working at the open source software center (OSS center) at NTT which is the largest telecommunications company group in Japan. For the purpose of software cost reduction, we have been carried out a lot of database migration projects so far.   Most of our customers are preferring so called \"DB migration project\", in which only the middle-ware DBMS will be replaced and AP itself will be reused. This is because such projects are usually considered more effective in terms of development time and cost than the \"rebuild\" projects, in which the system will be build again from scratch.  Nevertheless, the differences between old and new DBMSs often block the migration projects technically, and considerable number of projects may be giving up eventually. We found the major factors that make the migration difficult is following two:   * Cost of the estimation work   * Technical difficulty of the estimation work itself   As a solution of these problems, we have developed a non-compatible SQL auto-detection tool named db_syntax_diff. This tool can extract PostgreSQL incompatible SQLs in AP for Oracle and append each of them a difficulty index for migration. We've performed more than 30 database migration projects using this tool.   As another effort to solve migration problems, we are also working on function enhancement of orafce (Oracle emulation libraries). Based on the knowledge of frequently seen incompatibilities in the above estimations, we have added a large number of new entries to the orafce.", "session_type": {"name": "Talk of 45 minutes", "length": 0.3, "id": 450}, "video": null, "speakers": [{"name": "Kazuki Uehara", "organisation": "NTT OSS Center", "id": 1295}], "subtitle": null, "signup_url": null, "track": {"name": "Databases", "id": 254}, "audio": null, "short_abstract": "Short Abstract for the event", "microlocation": {"name": "Herschel Lab", "id": 247}}, {"end_time": "2016-03-19T11:00:00", "state": "accepted", "start_time": "2016-03-19T10:30:00", "slides": null, "comments": "", "title": "Demo Session", "language": null, "id": 1929, "long_abstract": "", "session_type": {"name": "Demo Talk", "length": 0.3, "id": 433}, "video": null, "speakers": [], "subtitle": null, "signup_url": null, "track": {"name": "Databases", "id": 254}, "audio": null, "short_abstract": "Short Abstract for the event", "microlocation": {"name": "Herschel Lab", "id": 247}}, {"end_time": "2016-03-19T11:30:00", "state": "accepted", "start_time": "2016-03-19T11:00:00", "slides": null, "comments": "", "title": "Data Warehouse in a PG / Greenplum / Vitesse DB environment", "language": null, "id": 1930, "long_abstract": "Upwork is the world\u2019s largest freelance talent marketplace, with 10+MM freelancers and 4+MM clients, and pays out more than $1+B annually in salaries.

Traditionally, MySQL Replication supports a single master and many slaves, and it is either asynchronous or semi-synchronous. A new replication plugin for MySQL has been around for some time and this is named MySQL Group Replication. This plugin provides multi-master update everywhere capabilities, making it possible to update data, concurrently, on any server in a group.

The environment of using the open source software in Taiwan is monopolized by expensive software, such as Microsoft series, Adobe and Photoshop. People seldom get a chance to realize that they actually have easy access to resources online which is free and much more convenient. Moreover, most of the budget of our country is used to buy the copyrights of software packages, but in practice we only use the basic functions of them. Simply put, we waste a lot of money buying something which is unnecessary. We discover it is the language barrier that makes people in Taiwan less likely to use open source software programs. Getting the deeper understanding of the serious problem we faced with, we come up with some solutions. Using big data to analyze vocabularies which are used frequently, we gather the information to indicate language barriers. Moreover, we can list out all the words which is hard for people, so that engineers can use the software and check the vocabularies at the same time. By using methods to remember the vocabularies, engineers can easily use the software. We can even use big data to analyze the steps which are used frequently and visualize them as a report. Like, we make a brief introduction to summarize the basic functions. So people only need to recognize the steps and check it through the introduction when they need. We launch a workshop to teach them step by step in English how to use the open source software. By enhancing engineers\u2019 English ability, now we can create a community to start influencing the general public. We create a community to overcome the language barrier and to change the habits of Taiwanese for using software. We start from NCKU and share with other schools. We create a platform for sharing the information of updated software. By translating the information from the internet like <a href=\"http://opensource.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">opensource.com</a>, we provide not only the materials for target group, but also chances to the general public to know the advantages of open source software.  On the other hand, we translate the video of \u201copensoucephysics\u201d to use the materials in our education system. By using the interesting videos and materials, teachers can inspire students to think outside the box and use their imagination to understand some difficult science concepts in classes. Furthermore, we can integrate the education materials with \u201cezgo\u201d and provide a chance for students to begin self-learning. We use three main methods to promote the use of open source software. First, we are going to launch a program which is composed of different schools such as NCKU, NCTU and NTU to create an engineering social media. Second, we cooperate with the professors and schools to open a course to invite students to join our translating program. Third, we create a social media and launch \u201chour of translate\u201d and invite friends to join us. Furthermore, we cooperate with the summer and winter camps to share our passion for open source software. To promote our ideas, we submit the application to teach for classes in other level of schools, such as elementary schools, junior schools and high schools.  It is necessary a waste that we seldom make the most of free resources online. We spend a lot of budget buying the software which is replaceable and deal with problems in an ineffective way.

The key will then be downloaded over an untrusted channel and the key obtained needs to be manually verified.  This presentation shows a novel approach to signing keys which makes it easy to sign a person's key. It enables very small groups of people to casually hold very small key signing parties.

Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.", "session_type": {"name": "Exhibition Area", "length": 0.3, "id": 458}, "video": null, "speakers": [{"name": "Alexandre Lision", "organisation": "Ring developped by Savoir-faire Linux", "id": 1323}], "subtitle": null, "signup_url": null, "track": {"name": "Exhibition", "id": 260}, "audio": null, "short_abstract": "Short Abstract for the event", "microlocation": {"name": "Ground Floor, Scientist For a day, Hall A", "id": 253}}, {"end_time": "2016-03-20T09:30:00", "state": "accepted", "start_time": "2016-03-20T09:00:00", "slides": null, "comments": "", "title": "FOSSASIA", "language": null, "id": 2094, "long_abstract": "FOSSASIA Exhibition", "session_type": {"name": "Exhibition Area", "length": 0.3, "id": 458}, "video": null, "speakers": [{"name": "Hong Phuc Dang", "organisation": "FOSSASIA", "id": 1154}], "subtitle": null, "signup_url": null, "track": {"name": "Exhibition", "id": 260}, "audio": null, "short_abstract": "Short Abstract for the event", "microlocation": {"name": "Ground Floor, Scientist For a day, Hall A", "id": 253}}, {"end_time": "2016-03-20T09:30:00", "state": "accepted", "start_time": "2016-03-20T09:00:00", "slides": null, "comments": "", "title": "Deepin Desktop System Demo", "language": null, "id": 2095, "long_abstract": "Deepin Desktop System showcase.", "session_type": {"name": "Exhibition Area", "length": 0.3, "id": 458}, "video": null, "speakers": [{"name": "Derek Dai", "organisation": "Deepin", "id": 1330}], "subtitle": null, "signup_url": null, "track": {"name": "Exhibition", "id": 260}, "audio": null, "short_abstract": "Short Abstract for the event", "microlocation": {"name": "Ground Floor, Scientist For a day, Hall A", "id": 253}}, {"end_time": "2016-03-20T09:30:00", "state": "accepted", "start_time": "2016-03-20T09:00:00", "slides": null, "comments": "", "title": "CryptoParty and/or key signing event", "language": null, "id": 2096, "long_abstract": "To the people who already know what a CryptoParty is: We are doing it, come!
